At this point, you may have realized that the code for `is_star_trek_improved` is very similar to the code for `is_star_wars_improved`. This isn't ideal for a few reasons: 1) it is more code to read, so the program is bigger 2) remember when we added the \\b? We had to do this for both is_star_trek_improved and is_star_wars_improved, there was twice the work involved.

Now we will write just one function called `are_keywords_in_title` to do it all. This function will take the title and a list of keywords as input. (You will need a loop if you didn't have one before). It will loop through the keywords, and if it finds a match, it will return True. If no matches are found, it will return False.

Both `is_star_trek_improved` and `is_star_wars_improved` can now be very short -- as the example code shows, all they need to do is define a list of keywords and pass them over to `are_keywords_in_title`, it is `are_keywords_in_title` that does all of the work.

One interesting thing about this change is that the program still functions exactly the same! We're not getting any new features, or fixing any bugs in the program by doing this. It is still a valuable thing to do, though. Now the program is less redundant. And we will see another good purpose for this later on.

Please write `are_keywords_in_title` and make sure the tests still pass.
