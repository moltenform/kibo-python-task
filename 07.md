## Final section: adding your own!

We'll first transform what we've written into an "object" style.

It's similar to what we did before in #5, when we moved code to a central shared place. In this case, the shared place is called a "base class". And the other functions that used to have redundant contents are now classes called "child classes". You will have to read a bit about objects to do this part. Code with "objects" is similar to the way the program worked before but there are a couple new things to learn. An object can contain `properties` (like its own variables) and `methods` (like its own functions, where the first parameter is always "self"). The `StarWarsChecker` will start out as a copy of `BaseKeywordChecker` but it can be customized. In this case we will be customizing the "init" method so that it sets the self.name and self.keywords to the right values.

Our new get_scores will now take a list of checkers and call the check() method on them. This way we're not limited to just the star wars and star trek ones, it will work with anything that has a check() method. (Recall "dictionaries". We are using a dictionary where the keys are the name of the checker and the value is the score).

## Then add your own!

The last part of the assignment is to get the score for a movie or TV show you like! Open up the data file and look through it until you see a reference to a movie or show you like. Then make a short list of related keywords - maybe the title of the show, and names of actors.

Once you have the list of keywords, you can add a new class like StarWarsChecker with the keywords list there.

And you don't even have to make any changes to get_scores! This is one of the best parts about code with "objects" - your new class has a `check()` method, so as long as you pass it as part of the list to get_scores, everything will work!

I know it was weird to change our program around in a way to make things into objects, because it didn't add any features or fix any bugs. The program functions the same as it used to, but we are trying to make it have a better structure - this concept is called "refactoring". In this case there is a real benefit to being able to make future additions to the program so quickly.

The end -- hope this was fun! Please share your scores for your favorite show with your classmates if you have a good example!
