### Is this Star Wars, Star Trek, or neither?

We will be looking at a data file and determining how popular Star Wars and Star Trek are! The data file is a list of webpage titles from the "Buzzfeed" website. 

Our first task will be to answer the question: if we are given a webpage title, is it related to Star Wars, Star Trek, or neither?

For simplicity we will have a fixed set of keywords to help us answer this question. If the title contains one of these keywords,

```
Star Wars
The Force
John Boyega
Carrie Fisher
Mark Hamill
```

we'll consider it related to Star Wars. If the title contains one of these keywords,

```
Star Trek
Warp Drive
Chris Pine
Kate Mulgrew
George Takei
```

we'll consider it related to Star Trek. It's true that this will not be 100% accurate, but we will call it good enough. (Please use a simple check to see if the title contains the keyword, you don't yet need to worry about capital letters, word boundaries, or how fast the program runs.)

This first section will be simple given your experience writing functions. Write a function `is_star_wars` that takes an input `title` and returns True or False. Write a function `is_star_trek` that takes an input `title` and returns True or False. You can view the "01.py" file, which has some examples, and fill it out.
