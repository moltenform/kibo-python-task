## Reflection

I intentionally kept the code very basic. No performance tricks, one-liners, or even list-comprehensions. Not even error-handling which might be a good follow-up task. This was on-purpose, to not distract from the main focus of the task.

(As I was running low on time, I wasn't able to explain objects very well in 07.md, usually I'd include a brief refresher on objects and base classes.)

- Why did you design the task the way you did? What factors did you consider?

    - thought it would be a fun discussion topic, favorite tv shows/movies
    
    - encourage communication between students -- like the optional challenge at the end of 06

    - be self directed - like the add-your-own part of 07, or the other extra credit challenges
    
    - i really like how kibo emphasized in its documents that it's not just solving the problem, it's building long term skills. so i tried to add information about refactoring. it's a good industry practice and a harder-to-describe part of good software engineering. many students won't really "feel" the need for refactoring the first time, but over time it will build muscle memory and they'll start to get it.

- What will students learn from the task?

    - reading data from files and doing basic totals computation
    
    - reducing redundant code by refactoring
    
    - making search act on whole words
    
    - it's more about the process than particularly getting a working program up.

- Where will students get stuck?

    - Potential place students could have bugs: when talling scores, they should remember that is_star_wars and is_star_trek could both be true.

    - some students like to have fuller understanding before proceeding. unfortunately, that is hard with regular expressions. may have to reach out to those students and let them take this one on faith, and then later explain more about this concept, as it is too much to dive into at the moment. although i suppose the this task presumes have been introduced to the material before.
    
    - hopefully students will be comfortable with using dictionaries and so they'll understand the  `scores` variable in the last assignment.
    
    - newer students, if they had used a series of `if`, might stumble at first into making this a loop. but this isn't a 101 class so they are probably well on their way to figuring it out!
