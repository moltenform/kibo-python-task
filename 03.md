### Reading the data file

We will now write code to read the data file. It is a file located in '../data/clickbait-input-data', you can open the file and see what it looks like.

As you can see, each line is one Buzzfeed article, and the semicolons (";") separate the data. For each line, the first item is a `unique id`, the second is a `article date`, the third is the `number of likes`, and the fourth is the `title`.

### Counting lines in the file

```
def count_data_lines()
```

Let's start simple and write a function that loops through the lines, and just counts how many lines are in the data. Please use your knowledge of how to open a text file and loop through the lines, and please skip any empty lines if they exist.

### Processing the file

```
def count_star_wars_related()
```

Let's now write another function to process the data. (We will call strip() on each line to remove any spaces or return characters at the beginning or end of the line). And then we can use the split() function to divide the line into items. The first item, `[0]` will contain the id, the second item, `[1]` will contain the article date, and so on. We now have enough to do some fun things! We can now count the star-wars related articles. Use `import code01` to get access to your code from earlier, and you can call `code01.is_star_wars(title)` to make use of the code you wrote earlier!

This will give us the number of articles that are star wars related -- great progress!
