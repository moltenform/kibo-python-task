Before we can compute the score, we realized that some Buzzfeed articles were about the Star Wars character named "Rey", and so we need to add "Rey" to the list of keywords.

Please make a new copy of the `is_star_wars` function from earlier and call it `is_star_wars_improved` add "Rey" to the list of keywords.

Once you do this, run the file, which will run the unit tests. You will see that one of the unit tests is failing! We are checking for the string "Rey", and it is accidentally picking up another character "Frank Reynolds", which it shouldn't, those are two very different characters :)

How do we check if we are matching "Rey" and not "Reynolds"?

We want to know if it is a whole-word match, and not part of another word. I'll dive into one possible approach, don't worry if you don't understand all of the details -- we could do this by looking for the location of the match in the string and checking the surrounding characters. For example, we would use `title.find("Rey")` to find the location of the match. Then we could use `title[location - 1]` to get the character before the location, and `title[location + len("Rey")]` to get the character after the location, and if any of those characters is another letter, this is not a whole word match. This works, but as you can tell, it's not super-easy (and we haven't taken into account the case where Rey is at the beginning or at the end).

Fortunately there is an quicker way to do this. We will use something called a "regular expression". Using regular expressions can be complicated, but in this case there is a nice way to look for a whole-word match.

If you put `import re` at the top of the file,

and write `if re.search('\\bRey\\b', title): return True` in your function, this will only return True if Rey is there as a whole word. And if s is equal to "Rey", we can write this, `if re.search(f'\\b{s}\\b', title): return True`.

The "b" stands for "boundary". This special type of search is not just about if one string is inside another, but can define a pattern for what matches and what doesn't. Regular expressions are highly powerful, but we will leave exploring them and understanding them to another class.

Please modify your is_star_wars_improved and is_star_trek_improved functions to do this -- put \\b at the beginning and end of the keywords and use re.search. That they only look at whole-words, and now the tests will pass.

(Side note: if our names had any strange symbols in them we would also need to use something called `re.escape`, but in this case our search keywords don't have any symbols and so it is fine to just add \\b at the beginning and end).
