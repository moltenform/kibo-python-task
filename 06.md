## Getting the score!

We can now get the score for everything.

Write a function called `get_scores`. As the template code shows, you can call into all the previous pieces you've built and put everything together. If an article is related to star wars, get the score for it and add to `total_score_star_wars`. And do the same for `total_score_star_trek`. At the end, return the total scores.

We can now compare the popularity of Star Trek and Star Wars :)

## Fun challenge (optional)

Talk with your friends about the results. If you wanted the other show to win, how much would you have to tweak the keywords, or tweak the input? It might be fun to collaborate with your friends in the class and pass around edited keywords or edited versions of the data file that get the other show to win! Explain why your tweaks work, and maybe you can make them sneaky, like hidden typos.
