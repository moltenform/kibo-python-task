## Getting the score!

We can now get the score for everything.

Write a function called `get_scores`. As the template code shows, you can call into all the previous pieces you've built and put everything together. If an article is related to star wars, get the score for it and add to `total_score_star_wars`. And do the same for `total_score_star_trek`. At the end, return the total scores.

We can now compare the popularity of Star Trek and Star Wars :)
