### Getting the score

This is another small assignment to get started.

On the "Buzzfeed" website, people can click to Like an article. Our data set contains the number of times an article has been Liked. When we compute popularity, it makes sense that an article a bunch of people have liked is more popular, so we will add this to the "score".

Let's write a function to get the popularity score for one article taking the number of likes into account.

Our formula for getting the popularity score is `1 + (# of likes) / 100`. The function will look like this,

```
def get_score(title, s_likes, s_article_date):
```

You should complete the function so that it returns a number, based on the formula. We can ignore the "title" and the "s_article_date" as they aren't used by our formula.

For the function we are writing right now, the number of likes is a string, like '123'. You will need to use a function to convert the string into a number before using it in the formula.

### (Optional extra credit task, difficult)

The `s_article_date` will have a value like `2015-12-20`. Because newer articles are more important, let's add to the formula. If the date is within the last 5 years, increase the points by 25% (which is the same as multiplying by 1.25). (You will need to do some online research for this and it won't be easy. Tips: you can convert a string into a Python datetime object with `datetime.fromisoformat`. You can get a datetime object for current day with `datetime.now()`. You can type `from datetime import datetime` to get access to datetime. You can subtract two datetimes to get a result object that has a "days" property that is the length of time in between them.)
